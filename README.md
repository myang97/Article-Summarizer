App Abilities/Bonuses:

-Uses an online API, Intellexer, to do the summarizations (http://esapi.intellexer.com/Home/Help).
-Bonus from the API: summarizes the content with an amount of sentences set as a constant, I edited the API call so that the user can decide how many sentences the API summarizes the content down to.
-Created a SharedPreference in order to save and restore the data whenever the orientation of the app changes or when the back button on the android is pushed
